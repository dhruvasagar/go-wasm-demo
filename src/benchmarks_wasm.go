// ============================================================================
// DEPRECATED BENCHMARK FUNCTIONS
// These functions have been consolidated into benchmarks_unified.go
// This file is kept for backward compatibility but functions have been moved
// ============================================================================

// NOTE: All benchmark functions have been moved to:
// - benchmarks_unified.go (new unified interface)
// - benchmarks_optimized.go (optimized implementations)
// - benchmarks_comprehensive.go (single-threaded and concurrent implementations)
// - benchmarks_shared.go (shared utility functions)

// This file can be removed in a future version once all dependencies
// have been updated to use the unified benchmark interface.
