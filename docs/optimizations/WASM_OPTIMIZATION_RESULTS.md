# WebAssembly Performance Optimization Results

## Overview

This document outlines the optimizations made to improve WebAssembly performance for three key benchmarks: Matrix Multiplication, Mandelbrot Set, and Simple Hash Function.

## Key Optimizations Applied

### 1. Matrix Multiplication

**Critical Issue Identified:**
- **27 Million Boundary Calls**: For 300x300 matrix, accessing JS arrays in hot loops created 27M JS↔WASM calls
- Each boundary call has ~50-100ns overhead, causing 45x slowdown vs JavaScript

**Optimizations Applied:**
- **Batch Data Transfer**: Copy entire JS arrays to Go slices ONCE (180K calls instead of 27M)
- **Pure Go Computation**: All matrix math happens in Go with zero boundary calls in hot loops  
- **Cache-Friendly Loop Order**: ikj order for better memory access patterns
- **Minimal Result Transfer**: Copy result back in single batch operation

**Performance Impact:**
- Before: 27,000,000 boundary calls → 1600ms (45x slower than JS)
- After: ~270,000 boundary calls → Should be competitive with JS

### 2. Mandelbrot Set

**Original Issues:**
- Creating JS Array and setting values one by one
- Using generic int type instead of fixed-size int32
- No loop unrolling

**Optimizations:**
- **Typed Arrays**: Use Int32Array for better memory efficiency
- **Bulk Transfer**: Process entire result in Go, then transfer once
- **Loop Unrolling**: Unroll first iteration for common cases
- **Direct Memory Copy**: Use `js.CopyBytesToJS()` with unsafe slice conversion

### 3. Simple Hash Function

**Original Issues:**
- String to byte conversion on every iteration
- Inefficient bit operations
- No loop unrolling

**Optimizations:**
- **Pre-convert String**: Convert string to bytes once before iterations
- **Loop Unrolling**: Process 4 bytes at a time when possible
- **Unsigned Operations**: Use uint32 throughout for consistent behavior
- **Minimize Allocations**: Reuse variables and avoid temporary allocations

## JavaScript Optimizations (Fair Comparison)

To ensure fair benchmarking, JavaScript implementations were also optimized:
- Used typed arrays (Float64Array, Int32Array)
- Applied same algorithmic optimizations
- Added loop unrolling where beneficial
- Used unsigned 32-bit operations for hash function

## Performance Tips

1. **Minimize JS<->WASM Calls**: Batch operations and transfer data in bulk
2. **Use Typed Arrays**: Float64Array, Int32Array are much faster than regular arrays
3. **Memory Layout**: Consider cache-friendly access patterns
4. **Direct Memory Transfer**: Use `js.CopyBytesToJS()` for bulk transfers
5. **Avoid Allocations**: Pre-allocate buffers and reuse them
6. **Loop Optimization**: Unroll tight loops for better performance

## Expected Results

With these optimizations, WebAssembly should achieve:
- **Matrix Multiplication**: 1.5-3x faster than JavaScript
- **Mandelbrot Set**: 2-4x faster than JavaScript
- **Hash Function**: 1.2-2x faster than JavaScript

The exact speedup depends on:
- Browser and its WebAssembly implementation
- Input size and complexity
- CPU architecture and cache size
- JavaScript engine optimizations

## Testing

Run benchmarks multiple times (5 runs averaged) to get stable results and account for:
- JIT compilation warmup
- CPU throttling
- Background processes
- Garbage collection pauses
