# WebAssembly on Mobile: Beyond the Browser üì±
## Extending Code Sharing to Native Mobile Platforms

> **Status:** This document covers current (2024) and emerging mobile WebAssembly capabilities, providing a realistic assessment of what works today vs what's coming.

## The Mobile Code Sharing Vision üåü

Imagine writing your complex business logic once in Go and running it **identically** across:
- ‚úÖ **Web browsers** (desktop & mobile)
- ‚úÖ **Server-side** (your backend APIs)
- ‚úÖ **React Native apps** (iOS & Android)
- ‚úÖ **Progressive Web Apps** (offline-capable)
- üöß **Native iOS apps** (experimental)
- üîÆ **Native Android apps** (coming via WASI)

This isn't science fiction‚Äîit's happening now, with even more capabilities on the horizon.

## Current State: What Works Today (2024) ‚úÖ

### 1. Mobile Web Browsers üåê

**Browser Support:**
- **99% of tracked web browsers support WebAssembly** (as of March 2024)
- iOS Safari: Full WebAssembly support (previously limited)
- Chrome Mobile, Firefox Mobile, Samsung Browser: Full support
- Progressive Web Apps: WebAssembly works seamlessly

**Real-World Example from Our Demo:**
```javascript
// Same validation logic runs identically in:
// - Desktop Chrome
// - iPhone Safari  
// - Android Chrome
// - iPad Safari
const result = window.validateUserWasm(JSON.stringify(userData));
```

**Perfect For:**
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- Mobile-first web applications
- Offline-capable mobile experiences

### 2. React Native Integration ‚ö°

**How It Works:**
- React Native can integrate WebAssembly for performance-critical sections
- WASM provides near-native performance for CPU-intensive tasks
- JavaScript handles UI, WebAssembly handles business logic

**Use Cases in Production:**
- Image processing and computer vision
- Complex mathematical calculations
- Cryptographic operations
- ML model inference
- Financial calculations (like our order calculator demo)

**Architecture Pattern:**
```javascript
// React Native Component
import { processComplexData } from './wasm-bridge';

const OrderCalculator = ({ order, user }) => {
  const result = processComplexData(order, user); // WASM call
  return <OrderSummary result={result} />;       // Native UI
};
```

### 3. WebView-Based Hybrid Apps üì¶

**Platforms:**
- Apache Cordova/PhoneGap
- Ionic Framework
- Electron (for desktop)

**Benefits:**
- WebAssembly works out-of-the-box
- Shared codebase with web version
- Consistent business logic across platforms

**From Our Demo:**
```go
// This exact validation function works in:
// - Web browsers ‚úÖ
// - Cordova/Ionic apps ‚úÖ  
// - Electron desktop apps ‚úÖ
func ValidateUser(user User) ValidationResult {
    // 9 complex validation rules
    // Consistent everywhere!
}
```

### 4. Native iOS Integration (Experimental) üß™

**Current Solutions:**
- **Wasm3 Runtime**: Lightweight WebAssembly interpreter for iOS
- **Wasmer 5.0**: Now supports iOS platform
- **Companies Using It**: Shareup compiles mission-critical code to WebAssembly and ships to all platforms, including iOS

**How It Works:**
```swift
// iOS Swift code calling WebAssembly
let wasmRuntime = WasmRuntime()
let result = wasmRuntime.call("validateUser", userData)
```

## Emerging Capabilities (2024-2025) üöß

### WASI: WebAssembly System Interface

**What WASI Enables:**
- WebAssembly programs that run outside browsers
- Secure, sandboxed execution on any platform
- Standard interface for system operations
- Mobile app integration without browser dependency

**Timeline:**
- **WASI Preview 2**: Launched early 2024
- **WASI Preview 3**: Expected mid-2025  
- **WASI 1.0 Stable**: Planned for 2026

**Future Mobile Integration:**
```go
//go:build wasi

// Go code compiled to WASI
// Will run natively on mobile via WASI runtime
func ProcessOrder(order Order) OrderResult {
    // Same business logic, mobile native performance
}
```

## Mobile Decision Framework üéØ

### Choose WebAssembly for Mobile When:

#### ‚úÖ **Strong Mobile WASM Use Cases**
- **Heavy Computation**: Image processing, ML inference, cryptography
- **Code Consistency**: Same business logic across web, mobile, server
- **Progressive Web Apps**: Want app-like experience without app stores
- **Offline-First**: Complex calculations must work without network
- **Rapid Prototyping**: One codebase, multiple platforms
- **Performance Critical**: Need predictable, near-native speed

#### üì± **Mobile Platform Strategy**
- **Today**: Focus on mobile browsers + React Native + experimental iOS
- **2025**: Plan for WASI Preview 3 native integration  
- **2026**: Full mobile app integration via WASI 1.0

### Choose Traditional Mobile Development When:

#### ‚ùå **Native Mobile Better For**
- **Pure Native UI**: Complex animations, platform-specific features
- **Deep Platform Integration**: Push notifications, camera, sensors
- **Battery Optimization**: Maximum power efficiency required
- **Simple Apps**: Minimal business logic complexity

### The Hybrid Sweet Spot:

**Best of Both Worlds:**
- Native UI for platform-specific features and performance
- WebAssembly for shared business logic and computation
- Progressive enhancement: works in browsers, enhanced in native apps

## Implementation Guide üõ†Ô∏è

### Starting with Mobile WASM Today

#### 1. Progressive Web App Approach
```bash
# Use our existing demo as foundation
git clone https://github.com/dhruvasagar/go-wasm-demo
cd go-wasm-demo
./build.sh

# Add PWA manifest and service worker
# Your Go business logic works immediately on mobile browsers!
```

#### 2. React Native Integration
```javascript
// Install WebAssembly support
npm install react-native-wasm

// Import your compiled WASM
import { validateUser } from './compiled/main.wasm';

// Use in React Native component
const result = validateUser(userData);
```
