    // Advanced credit risk calculations
    riskFactor := calculateCreditRisk(creditScore)
    adjustedRate := monthlyRate * riskFactor
    
    // PMT calculation with risk adjustments
    payment := principal * (adjustedRate * math.Pow(1+adjustedRate, numPayments)) / 
               (math.Pow(1+adjustedRate, numPayments) - 1)
    
    return LoanTerms{
        MonthlyPayment: payment,
        TotalInterest:  payment*numPayments - principal,
